The planting application is designed to be a tool for tree-planting companies to use as a tool for tracking planter performance and determining an efficient configuration of workers for the maximum efficiency. 
The application will store basic contact information for planters. It will store performance statistics for each planter throughout the season including daily production and daily tree-price.
The application will store information about crews including size, specific members, average production
The application will store information about the contracts throughout the season including planted/remaining blocks.
The application will store information about the blocks of each contract including planted/remaining trees, tree-price.
The application will be manually updated by the user at the end of each day. The application will then generate a daily report and update planter and crew information based on the report. 
The application will then be able to generate an optimal configuration of crews for the remaining blocks in the conctract

Future considerations:
- Block access -> Quads? Are crews able to use quads?
- Production influences -> price, slash, steep, flat, wet (to start, price is good rough indicator of general difficulty)
- Do planters have access to application?
- Multiple management accounts?
